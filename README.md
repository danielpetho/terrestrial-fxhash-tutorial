## Project on fxhash
The project is released under this [link](). 256 edition, for 5 tezos. ?% of the proceedings (including secondary shares/royalties) go to [this](https://tzkt.io/KT1DWnLiUkNtAQDErXxudFEH63JC6mqg3HEx/) donation contract, which was setup by the fxhash and the [Versum](https://versum.xyz/) team. This contract splits the received funds between different charities ([Save The Children](https://thegivingblock.com/donate/save-the-children/), [Direct Relief](https://thegivingblock.com/donate/direct-relief/), etc.). You can read more on the contract [here](https://github.com/teia-community/teia-docs/wiki/Ukranian-Fundraising). If you want to support a good cause, mint one for yourself!:)
